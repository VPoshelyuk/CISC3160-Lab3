# CISC3160-Lab3
Grade calculator for CISC3160 using lex and yacc
### About
---
This directory holds a grade calculator for CISC3160 class made using lex and yacc.   
This is an improved version of the program developed for Lab 2 that includes better error handling and is much more interactive.    
There is a Makefile included in this repo, so, assuming you have lex and yacc installed and you are using UNIX based machine, you can give my grade calculator a try by cloning this repo and running the following command inside of code folder: `make calculate_grade`   
There is also a writing portion of the assignment attached as a .pdf document. And an image of a test run.
